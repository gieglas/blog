### Importance of Versioning Policy

Having a versioning policy is crucial, especially for projects intended to be used by third parties. A well-defined versioning policy ensures that users can reliably track changes, updates, and improvements to the software. It provides a clear framework for managing and communicating changes, which is essential for maintaining compatibility and stability.
## Release policy

Versioning isn’t just about numbers and tags—it’s a **commitment to quality, reliability, and trust**. While using Git tags and following the three-part versioning system (SemVer) is a great start, it’s only part of the story. A truly effective versioning strategy requires a clear release policy, a commitment to maintaining compatibility, and a sense of responsibility to the third parties who rely on your software. 
### Considerations for a release policy
A well-defined release policy should address the following key areas to ensure smooth, reliable, and predictable software updates:
1. **Alignment with organizational policies**
    - Ensure changes comply with relevant organizational policies, such as branding guidelines, GDPR compliance, and accessibility standards.
    - Example: If your organization mandates WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, all releases must be tested for and meet these accessibility requirements.
2. **Alignment with project goals and principles**
    - Changes should support the project’s core goals and principles.
    - Example: If the goal is to accelerate development, new features should simplify workflows and reduce complexity for developers.
3. **Backward compatibility**
    - Non-major releases (minor and patch versions) must maintain backward compatibility.
    - Example: Avoid introducing breaking changes in patch updates; reserve them for major releases with clear migration paths.
4. **Feature interaction and integration**
    - Consider how new features or changes interact with existing ones.
    - Example: In a Design System, a new Hint component should be tested alongside related components (e.g., Text Inputs) to ensure seamless integration.
5. **Consistency across releases**
    - Maintain consistency in how features are implemented and used.
    - Example: If text content is defined as `{"en":"Some text","el":"Περιεχόμενο"}` in existing features, new features should follow the same pattern.
6. **Regression testing**
    - Test every release against existing functionality to catch regressions early.
    - Example: Use automated regression tests to ensure new changes don’t break existing features.
7. **Update related products or tools**
    - Ensure that all related products or tools are updated as needed.
    - Example: A change in the Design System may require updates to its rendering tool or usage documentation.
8. **Documentation and communication**
    - Provide detailed changelogs, release notes, and upgrade guides for every release.
    - Example: Clearly document breaking changes in major releases and provide migration steps for developers.
9. **Release frequency and scheduling**
    - Define a predictable release schedule to manage expectations.
    - Example: Commit to monthly patch releases and quarterly minor releases, with major releases planned once every year.
10. **Stakeholder involvement**
    - Involve relevant stakeholders (e.g., product managers, developers, QA teams) in the release process.
    - Example: Conduct a release review meeting to ensure all teams are aligned before deployment.
11. **Rollback and emergency fixes**
    - Plan for rollback procedures and emergency fixes in case of critical issues.
    - Example: Maintain a hotfix branch for urgent patches and ensure rollback mechanisms are tested.
12. **User feedback and impact assessment**
    - Gather feedback from the users to assess the impact of changes.
    - Example: Use surveys, feedback forms and metrics to understand how updates affect third-party integrations.
13. **Security and compliance**
    - Ensure releases meet security and compliance requirements.
    - Example: Conduct security audits for major releases and ensure compliance with industry standards like ISO 27001.
14. **Automation and tooling**
    - Leverage automation tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines) to streamline the release process.
    - Example: Automate version tagging, testing, and publishing to reduce manual errors (more on that later). 
15. **Training and support**
    - Provide training and support for external developers or teams adapting to new changes.
    - Example: Host webinars or create tutorials to explain new features or migration steps.

By adopting a clear release policy with the above considerations, you can ensure your software remains a dependable choice for your users.
