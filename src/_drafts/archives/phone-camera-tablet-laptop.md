I love integrating stuff, either cloud like stuff (see [Productivity Services 101](../productivity-services-101/), [Multi-OS/device Task Management with toodledo](../multi-os-device-task-management-with-toodledo/), or hardware stuff (see [ASUS PadFone](../asus-padfone-the-smartphone-that-docks-into-a-tablet/). The trend was to have devices that do everything, like a phone that you can use to communicate with others, take photos or videos, browse the web, read news, check out a map, play games, send rockets to outer space, make coffee … (you get the picture). That’s all nice and dandy but at the end of the day in our effort to save time, do everything on the road, be more productive and so on, we end up loosing the very characteristics that make each device unique for its purpose. For example you can type much faster using a full keyboard rather the one on your little smartphone’s touchscreen. And trust me, making calls from a Samsung Galaxy tablet is not an easy task.

This design by Prashant Chandra proposes to keep the different devices uniqueness and come together to form a laptop (which is still the most versatile device). So you get all these gadgets that can still do all those cool stuff, but still keep their identity, and when you really need the power you simply connect and use the laptop. You can think of this like a bunch of (really cute in this case) transformers coming together to form a giant mega transformer. And that’s just awesome.
