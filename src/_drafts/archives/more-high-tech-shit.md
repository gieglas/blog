Behold the Kohler – numi toilet. The high tech shit saga continues with this out of this world product. Notice that this is not a concept design or something… It’s an actual product.

Though I think it is a total waste of money, I have to admit they made a no touch solution… meaning you don’t have to touch anything other than the touchscreen. Some of it’s features are motion detection lit and seat, deodorizer, heated seats and feet, illuminated panels and can play music as well.

I left out my favourite features for last because of the really interesting accidents that could happen… the advanced bidet functionality and the integrated air dryer. What happens is a small tube appears from the back of the toilet … right underneath your biological exits… and either sprays or blows.
