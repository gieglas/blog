I made a big mistake on my [previous post](../evernote-control-your-data-2/). It seems the attachments are no longer saved on a separate folder locally but within the Evernote Database file (`xxxxxx.exb`). This is a great example of an application or service changing the way things work in your own world and that is exactly the reason why you need to keep a copy of the latest working Evernote installation file.

This does not change anything in the way I backup my data as explained in my [previous post](../evernote-control-your-data/), but with a change like that one might have to re-thing the whole disaster recovery procedure. For now personally I am happy with my setup and I feel confident about my backup procedure.

Consider backing up your data with a high quality NAS like Synology.
