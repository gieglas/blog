Remember my post about [the power of simplicity with IFTTT](http://gieglas.com/342-power-by-simplicity-with-ifttt/ "Power by simplicity with ifttt") and well you noticed my obsession with [Evernote](http://gieglas.com/Topics/evernote/ "Evernote topic"). What better way to “put the Internet to work for me” (as [IFTTT.com](https://ifttt.com/ "ifttt.com") says) than to combine the two and have an automatic method of backing up and archiving my posts in Evernote. In this post I will guide you on how to use the RSS and Evernote channels in IFTTT to do just that.

Here’s what to do:

- Navigate to [https://ifttt.com/](https://ifttt.com/)and login with your credentials. (If you don’t have an account simply make one). 
- Click on “**Create a Recipe**“
- Click on the word “**This**” and select the “**Feed**” channel.

- In “**Choose a Trigger**” select the “**New Feed Item**“.
- In “**Complete Trigger Fields**” enter your RSS feeds url and click on “**Create Trigger**“.

- Click on the word “**That**” and select the “**Evernote**” channel. (Note: you must to first activate the Evernote channel )

- In “**Choose an Action**” select the “**Create a Note**“
- Complete the Action Fields with the information you want

- Click “**Create Action**“

That’s it. Ok now I created it i’ll let you know how it looks like as soon as I publish this :-).

UPDATE: It worked 🙂
