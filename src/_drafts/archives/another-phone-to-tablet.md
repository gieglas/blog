Seems another company is considering a phone to tablet duo. After [Asus](http://gieglas.com/47-asus-padfone-the-smartphone-that-docks-into-a-tablet/ "ASUS PadFone, the smartphone that docks into a tablet") and [CMIT](http://gieglas.com/66-cmits-transphone-also-doubles-as-a-tablet/ "CMIT’s TransPhone also doubles as a tablet") Fujitsu jumps in the game with this beautiful idea.
