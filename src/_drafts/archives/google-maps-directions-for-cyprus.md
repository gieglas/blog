At long last you can find your way in Cyprus withÂ [google maps](http://maps.google.com/). Directions have been enabled on their platform and the street coverage seems to be decent. You can search streets using both English or Greek names. Now everyone with moble internet and google maps on their phones have a GPS navigation system on their hands. Have fun.
