We looked at [Asus PadFone](http://gieglas.com/47-asus-padfone-the-smartphone-that-docks-into-a-tablet/ "ASUS PadFone, the smartphone that docks into a tablet") and we said that that was not the first time someone came up with the idea of a phone to tablet dock. Seems CMIT’s TransPhone also announced a smartphone that can be inserted into a larger multi touch display turning into a tablet. TransPhone has a 1.2GHz Qualcomm processor and a SVGA display. It is unclear on which OS it will run on but it is said that it will offer uniqueness on OS, UI, software and apps… whatever that means.

Though its not a game changer like with what happened with the iPhone and the iPad, it seems there is a new trend of smartphone to tablet integration and it will be interesting to see what will come out of it.
