Take a look at this design. The aim of the designer (Jose GenovÃ©s) is to reduce water consumption and it does so by handling different type of waste with different methods. I wont get into too much detail, instead I will let your imagination run wild with this photo (or check out the source link and just read all about it ðŸ™‚ ). One thing is for sureâ€¦ this will be the first toilet that will need a user manual to operate.
