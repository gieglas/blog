As the obsession with getting organized grows, so does the technology and the services that are out there. [Doit.im](http://doit.im/){target="_blank"} seems to be growing up nicely and provides a great candidate tool for our GTD needs. The service is based on the GTD principles, and they provide a stunning user experience on all platforms(mobile, tablet and web).

### GTD Explained

Starting from their website, I often use their [Features page](http://doit.im/features){target="_blank"} as a reference to explain the main principles of GTD. I meet a lot of people that are intimidated by GTD (most of them stop when they see a flow diagram), so I like to give them a more simplified description at first to get them started. Looking at Doit.im’s feature page you’ll see just that explained in one page and with 4 distinct steps:  
**1) Collect** -> **2) Process and Organize** -> **3) Review** -> **4) Pick next action and Do**.

### Smart-Add

Smart-Add is a feature that provides additional value to this service. It allows users to add **Collect**, **Process** and **Organize** tasks within seconds. It is basically a text box where you would normally type in your task, and by entering some special characters, you can set the task’s **Start Date**, **Context**, **Project**, **Priority**, and **Tags**. As soon as you type these special characters (see table below), a drop down appears with the available values you can enter. This feature exists on the mobile apps as well. In Android there is a button on the notification area, where by clicking on it you can Smart-Add tasks without opening the application.

Smart-Add special characters table:

| Attribute  | Special Character |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Start Date | ^                 |
| Context    | @                 |
| Project    | #                 |
| Priority   | !                 |
| Tag        | &                 |

 This feature makes the whole GTD process extremely productive by reducing the time needed to Process and Organize the tasks. It is similar to the method described in my previous post [Getting Organized with Evernote – GTD Task Management](../getting-organized-with-evernote-gtd-task-management/ ).

### User Interface

One thing that stands out is Doit.im’s stunning UI. Apart from the beautiful design (in web, mobile and tablet), the application always helps you complete the task in hand (i.e. create a task). The navigation area on the left helps you perform your Task Management with ease and with the help of customized filters and advanced search, you can pretty much perform any search query possible.

On a more technical note, the app uses AJAX and JSON to perform its tasks which makes everything faster and lighter. Completing an action in Doit.im (save something, search, view a list of tasks …) is very smooth and direct either by pressing “Enter/Return” key or with a single click.

### Conclusion

Doit.im is ideal for GTD enthusiasts and people that want more than just a task list. It combines a good methodology, smart UI and fast web services to provide a cross platform solution to get your things done. All of the characteristics described above make Doit.im very easy to use. The interaction between user and application feels very natural which results in a frustration free experience.
