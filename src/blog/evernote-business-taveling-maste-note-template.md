Further on the whole notion of Master notes described on [Daniel E. Gold’s book “Guide To Capturing Everything and Getting Things Done”](https://transactions.digitaldeliveryapp.com/stores/910/1819 "Evernote: The Unofficial eBook"){target="_blank"}, I have created a template that I use for business traveling which I am presenting in this post.

I talked about [Business Traveling](../evernote-working-example-business-meeting-2/) before where I described 4 Templates for my travels. In an attempt to evolve, I now have merged those templates to come up with 1 master note for easier access to information. Having one or more notes is really a matter of personal preference (though it does affect how productive you are). What I really want to point out in this post is that having templates on repeating procedures can help do things a lot faster and  increase the quality of your work.

Again the structure of the Master Note below has been adjusted to my needs and the procedures of my organization, so it might not apply to everyone. Here it is:
