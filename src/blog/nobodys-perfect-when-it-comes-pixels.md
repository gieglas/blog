So it seems that even big old mighty Google makes mistakes on its UI. Take a look at this screenshoot from google calendar, you’ll see that the “All Day” lines are not aligned with the rest on the week view. Of course I had to do a full screen on a 1680 by 1050 resolution to notice, and its really not that big of a deal, but am glad am not the only one who can’t get around aligning tables and divs 🙂
