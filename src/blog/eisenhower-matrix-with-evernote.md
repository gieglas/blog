So it’s been a long time since I wrote something but here I am. I recently talked with a friend of mine that uses the Eisenhower Matrix technique and I though why not do that with Evernote.

  
Its really simple actually. Just created 4 tags:

- 1. Important
- 1. Not Important
- 2. Urgent
- 2. Not Urgent

The numbering is a little different in my system but that does not matter really, it’s just a way to easily organize notes and recognize tags. Then I created 4 saved searches:

- Name: **DO** Query: **tag:1-Important tag:2-Urgent**
- Name: **DECIDE** Query: **tag:1-Important tag:”2-Not Urgent”**
- Name: **DELEGATE** Query: **tag:”1-Not Important” tag:2-Urgent**
- Name: **DELETE** Query: **tag:”1-Not Important” tag:”2-Not Urgent”**

I then created some Windows desktop shortcuts (In front of the background you see on the image above) that open Evernote and searches the queries described above. For example “C:\path\to\evernote\**ENScript.exe** **showNotes /q “tag:1-Important tag:2-Urgent”**“.

There you have it your own Eisenhower Matrix on Evernote. You can even make better queries to search for Evernote Reminders. For more information about the Eisenhower Matrix see the sources link below.
