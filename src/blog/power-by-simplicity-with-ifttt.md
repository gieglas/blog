With [ifttt.com](http://ifttt.com/ "http://ifttt.com/"){target="_blank"} you can create tasks depending triggers from various channels on the basis of “**I**f **t**his **t**hen **t**hat”. Sounds very basic … and it is. Its power though comes from combining different channels giving its users the chance to automate a lot of processes done manually up to now. Classic example is when you are tagged on a new image on facebook, download it in your dropbox account. Pretty cool right?

This is how it works. As the photo explains **if some event** happens **then do something**. To further explain I will create a task that will send me SMS alerts when IBM’s stocks rise higher than 200 (very practical example, of course Cyprus stock exchange is not included as always ). So here it goes:

Click on Create a task from the Dashboard
![IFTTT dashboard](../../img/Pasted%20image%2020241211193645.jpg)

Click on “This” on the sentence to declare the event
![IFTTT this](../../img/Pasted%20image%2020241211193723.jpg)

Select the Trigger Channel you want to use. In our case select Stocks
![IFTTT choose trigger](../../img/Pasted%20image%2020241211193755.jpg)

Choose the Trigger specific to that channel. In out case select “Price rises above”
![IFTTT choose trigger in this channel](../../img/Pasted%20image%2020241211193830.jpg)

Complete the Trigger Field values. In our case on Ticker Symbol enter “IBM” and on Price “200”
![IFTTT trigger fields](../../img/Pasted%20image%2020241211193859.jpg)

Click on “That” of the sentence to declare the action
![IFTTT that action](../../img/Pasted%20image%2020241211193930.jpg)

Choose Action channel. In our case select “SMS”
![IFTTT choose action](../../img/Pasted%20image%2020241211193956.jpg)

Choose action specific to that channel. In our case there is only one option click on “Send me a text message”.
![IFTTT send me a message action](../../img/Pasted%20image%2020241211194037.jpg)

Complete the action fields.

And there you have it. Simple isn’t it?

I have to comment the simplicity of it’s user interface. I cannot stress enough how important it is to have simple UIs when dealing with Web apps. Maybe in this case it needs some color or something… but I love the simple and illustrative way of creating a task. Well done.
