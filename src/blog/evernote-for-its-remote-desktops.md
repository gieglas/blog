Its been a while but am back ðŸ˜Š. So taking advantage of the premium feature of attaching any file type on Evernote, you can create a single note to help you manage your servers (via Remote Desktops).

Just save your remote desktop settings in RDP files and drag them into your note. I use the RDP filename to distinguish the servers but you could always add more details on the note next to each attachment. I especially like the fact that you canÂ **encode**Â the text so you can include details such as credentials.Â More Details on encryption at thisÂ [Evernote support page](https://support.evernote.com/link/portal/16051/16058/Article/1652/What-type-of-encryption-does-Evernote-use "What type of encryption does Evernote use?"){target="_blank"}.
