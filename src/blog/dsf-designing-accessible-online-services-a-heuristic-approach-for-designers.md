Check out the link below for the post I wrote for the [Digital Services Factory (DSF)](https://dsf.dmrid.gov.cy/){target="_blank"}, that explores how the accessibility heuristics table and scoring system work, how to use heuristic evaluation, and how designers can apply this in practice. The heuristics used in this post were adapted to align with the Unified Design System (UDS).
