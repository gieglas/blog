Releasing software updates isn’t just about numbers and tags—it’s a **commitment to quality, reliability, and trust**. While using adopting [Semantic Versioning and automation](../why-release-versioning-matters-a-guide-to-semver-and-automated-publishing/) is a great start, it’s only part of the story. A truly effective versioning strategy requires a clear release policy, a commitment to maintaining compatibility, and a sense of responsibility to the third parties who rely on your software. 

In this post, we’ll explore the key aspects of a release policy and provide a practical checklist to help ensure it’s consistently followed.
## Considerations for a release policy
A well-defined release policy should address the following key areas to ensure smooth, reliable, and predictable software updates:
1. <span aria-hidden="true">📋</span> **Alignment with organizational policies** 
    - Ensure changes comply with relevant organizational policies, such as branding guidelines, GDPR compliance, and accessibility standards.
    - Example: If your organization mandates WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, all releases must be tested for and meet these accessibility requirements.
2. <span aria-hidden="true">🎯</span> **Alignment with project goals and principles** 
    - Changes should support the project’s core goals and principles.
    - Example: If the goal is to accelerate development, new features should simplify workflows and reduce complexity for developers.
3. <span aria-hidden="true">🔢</span> **Adopting Semantic versioning** 
    - Use the Semantic versioning scheme assign version numbers.
    - Example: Check out the post on [Semantic Versioning and automation](../why-release-versioning-matters-a-guide-to-semver-and-automated-publishing/) .
4. <span aria-hidden="true">🔄</span> **Backward compatibility** 
    - Non-major releases (minor and patch versions) must maintain backward compatibility.
    - Example: Avoid introducing breaking changes in patch updates; reserve them for major releases with clear migration paths.
5. <span aria-hidden="true">🔗</span> **Feature interaction and integration** 
    - Consider how new features or changes interact with existing ones.
    - Example: In a Design System, a new Hint component should be tested alongside related components (e.g., Text Inputs) to ensure seamless integration.
6. <span aria-hidden="true">🔄</span> **Consistency across releases** 
    - Maintain consistency in how features are implemented and used.
    - Example: If text content is defined as `{"en":"Some text","el":"Περιεχόμενο"}` in existing features, new features should follow the same pattern.
7. <span aria-hidden="true">🧪</span> **Regression testing** 
    - Test every release against existing functionality to catch regressions early.
    - Example: Use automated regression tests to ensure new changes don’t break existing features.
8. <span aria-hidden="true">🔧</span> **Update related products or tools** 
    - Ensure that all related products or tools are updated as needed.
    - Example: A change in the Design System may require updates to its rendering tool or usage documentation.
9. <span aria-hidden="true">📚</span> **Documentation and communication** 
    - Provide detailed changelogs, release notes, and upgrade guides for every release.
    - Example: Clearly document breaking changes in major releases and provide migration steps for developers.
10. <span aria-hidden="true">📅</span> **Release frequency and scheduling** 
    - Define a predictable release schedule to manage expectations.
    - Example: Commit to monthly patch releases and quarterly minor releases, with major releases planned once every year.
11. <span aria-hidden="true">🤝</span> **Stakeholder involvement** 
    - Involve relevant stakeholders (e.g., product managers, developers, QA teams) in the release process.
    - Example: Conduct a release review meeting to ensure all teams are aligned before deployment.
12. <span aria-hidden="true">🚨</span> **Rollback and emergency fixes** 
    - Plan for rollback procedures and emergency fixes in case of critical issues.
    - Example: Maintain a hotfix branch for urgent patches and ensure rollback mechanisms are tested.
13. <span aria-hidden="true">📣</span> **User feedback and impact assessment**
    - Gather feedback from the users to assess the impact of changes.
    - Example: Use surveys, feedback forms and metrics to understand how updates affect third-party integrations.
14. <span aria-hidden="true">🔒</span> **Security and compliance** 
    - Ensure releases meet security and compliance requirements.
    - Example: Conduct security audits for major releases and ensure compliance with industry standards like ISO 27001.
15. <span aria-hidden="true">🤖</span> **Automation and tooling** 
    - Leverage automation tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines) to streamline the release process.
    - Example: Automate [version tagging](../why-release-versioning-matters-a-guide-to-semver-and-automated-publishing/), testing, and publishing to reduce manual errors. 
16. <span aria-hidden="true">🎓</span> **Training and support** 
    - Provide training and support for external developers or teams adapting to new changes.
    - Example: Host webinars or create tutorials to explain new features or migration steps.

## Release checklist
Having a checklist helps to ensure that every update follows a structured process. Instead of walking you through a long policy document, I’m sharing a practical checklist that I use to ensure the release policy for our Design System is followed. I’ve made some adjustments to make it more generic, but it still reflects the key considerations of a Design System project. If you plan to use it, don’t just copy and paste—adapt it to fit the specifics of your own project.
### 1. <span aria-hidden="true">🔍</span> Discover 
Identify the purpose and impact of the proposed change to ensure alignment with project goals and policies.
- <span aria-hidden="true">🔲</span> **Purpose** - Clearly articulate the **reason for the change**.
