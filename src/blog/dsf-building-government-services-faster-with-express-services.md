Over the past months, we’ve been delivering real government services at [Digital Services Factory (DSF)](https://dsf.dmrid.gov.cy/){target="_blank"} using [Express Services](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gov-cy/govcy-express-services){target="_blank"}, a Node.js / Express-based framework designed for building linear government online services on [gov.cy](http://gov.cy/).  

It provides a shared foundation for common service needs like page flows, validation, authentication, review pages, and secure submission, allowing teams to focus on user needs instead of rebuilding infrastructure.  
  
The result so far:  
- faster delivery  
- more consistent services  
- less technical overhead  
- more focus on user needs  
  
Express Services is intentionally simple and opinionated, aligned with the Unified Design System and the Service Standard. It supports delivery, without replacing the responsibility of service teams for quality, security, and compliance.  
  
Express Services is already being used to deliver real services, such as [Apply for an ISBN](https://www.gov.cy/en/service/apply-for-isbn/){target="_blank"}, and [Report hazardous cosmetics](https://www.gov.cy/en/service/report-hazardous-cosmetics/){target="_blank"}.
