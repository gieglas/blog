I have come to realize the importance of Master Notes, a notion that is talked extensively on [Daniel E. Gold’s book “Guide To Capturing Everything and Getting Things Done”](https://transactions.digitaldeliveryapp.com/stores/910/1819 "Evernote: The Unofficial eBook"){target="_blank"}. In this post I am presenting the template I am using for Project Master Notes.

I realize everyones' needs are different and something that applies to me might not apply to someone else, but still I would apreciate everyones input, so please do comment.

So here it is:
## **Master Project Note** V.0

### 1. Project Description

Brief Description of the project

### 2. Organizing

##### 2.1. People

Project Team and all other important **people** that are involved with the project, their **contact info** and **roles**.

##### 2.2. Tools Sites Services

Any sites, services or tools of any kind that you would use in this project. Avoid having login information here unless you **encrypt** them.

### 3. Plan, Milestones, Tasks, Progress

##### 3.1. Official

Official Plan and progress here. The distinction official/working is not necessary. Important to distinguish **who** does **what**, **deadlines** and **mark result**. You could use **Links** for additional information on Tasks.

##### 3.2. Working

### 4. Documentation

##### 4.1 Official Docs

All official documents. Documents such as Analysis, Design, Budget, Reports, Cost Estimations and so on. You are advised to use **Links** if you have a lot of documents.

##### 4.2 Other Docs (Supporting)

Any other supporting documents that you would need to perform your tasks.

### 5. Notes

##### 5.1. General Notes

Important notes for your or your teams reference, such as decisions etc.

##### 5.2. Questions n Answers

Often need to find an answer that you already asked fast, or find the reference to the documentation fast. Again you should use **Links**. Can use to write fast the questions you need to have answered.

##### 5.3 Research

Reference to research notes. Again you should use **Links**.

### 6. Log

Event based Log. Again you should use **Links**.
