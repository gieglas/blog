Documentation is a key for any coding project and the README file is a big part of it. In this article you can find some best practices on how to write a good README file.

## Why having a good README file is important
A well-crafted README file can be an essential tool for sharing information about your project. A properly formatted and organized README can help potential users and contributors quickly understand the purpose, functionality, and usage of your project. In addition, popular code hosting services like GitHub and NPM rely heavily on README files to display project information and make it more discoverable to users.

Investing time and effort in creating a high-quality README file can pay off in numerous ways. It can save time and effort in the long run, build trust, attract new users and contributors, and even improve the quality of your code. So don’t underestimate the importance of the all mighty README file!

## Best practices
### Keep it to the point and clean
While it’s important to provide all the necessary information, you also want to keep your README file concise and to the point. Users should be able to quickly understand what your project does and how to use it without getting into unnecessary details. Use bullet points and formatting to break up your content and make it more scannable.

Make sure to use clear, easy-to-understand language when writing your README file. Avoid using technical jargon or overly complex language that might confuse users. If you do need to use technical terms, make sure to explain them clearly so that users who aren’t familiar with the technology can still understand.

### Make It Easy to Navigate
Your README file should be easy to navigate and understand. Use headings and subheadings to organize your content and make it easy for users to find the information they’re looking for. If your project is complex, consider including a table of contents at the beginning of your README.

### Keep It Up to Date
Your README file should always be up to date with the latest information about your project. Make sure to update it whenever you make changes to your project. Include a date stamp, or version number at the top of the file to indicate when it was last updated. Keeping a good changelog file is also a good idea.

### Include Installation and Setup Instructions
Make sure to include clear, step-by-step instructions for installing and setting up your project. This should include information about any dependencies or prerequisites that need to be installed, as well as any configuration options that users might need to set up before using your project.

### Include Examples and Code Snippets
Including examples and code snippets can help users understand how to use your project in practice. You might include sample code that demonstrates how to use your project’s API, or screenshots that show what your project looks like in action. This can help make your project more intuitive and accessible.

### Include a License
Finally, make sure to include a clear statement about the license under which your project is released. This can help users understand how they’re allowed to use and distribute your project, and can help avoid any confusion or legal issues down the line.

### Template README file
Here’s a template you can use to get started in your own README file:

```markdown
Description what the project does and who is the intended audience (i.e. developers, QA teams etc)
 
## Features
 
List the features of the project in bullet points
 
## Prerequisites
 
Note any pre-requisites and dependencies needed for this project. For example:
 
- Nodejs 8+
 
## Installation
 
Explain the steps needed to install the project. For example:
 
- git clone https://github.com/your-project-path.git
- cd your-project-path
- npm install
 
## Usage
 
Explain how to use the project. This might include "How to" instructions and code segments
 
If the project provides customization or configuration, list all (or the most important) customizations with examples. 
 
If you have complicated API's or more detailed definitions, make sure to link them in your README file.
 
## Credits
 
Give credits to contributors or any other open source projects that helped.
 
## Notes
 
Any other notes you feel are important.
 
## License
 
Mention the license for example:"This project is released under the [MIT License](LICENCE.md)."
 
## Contact
 
Explain how people can make questions or provide feedback on the project, for example:
 
If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us at [yourmail@yourmail.com](mailto:yourmail@yourmail.com)
```
By following these best practices, you can create a README file that is clear, concise, and easy to understand. This can help users get up and running with your project quickly and easily, and can make your project more accessible to a wider audience.
